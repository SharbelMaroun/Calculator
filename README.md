# Calculator
This project implements an arithmetic calculator that supports multiple numerical bases (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal). The calculator evaluates expressions, performs arithmetic operations, and supports bitwise operations. The application allows users to input mathematical expressions, validate the expression based on the selected base, and compute the result. It includes a user interface built with JavaFX, allowing users to interact with the app via a graphical interface. The app features a flexible base conversion system, supporting dynamic conversion between bases.
